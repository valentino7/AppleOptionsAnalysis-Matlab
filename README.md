### Prerequisites


```
-Matlab
```

### Work

The prediction is made with a Neural Network on Keras Backend. The steps of the algorithm are: 
- preprocessing data (replace null value with mean or frequency, transformation of categorical features, drop column, standardization
- feature selection (PCA)
- Tuning of parameter with grid search parameter(number of layers,number of neurons,batch size, epochs,dropout,optimizer.
